# Computer Networks Project

This project, completed for the Computer Networks course, demonstrates practical application of network layer concepts through packet analysis and network simulation.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Wireshark Packet Analysis
Captured and analyzed live network traffic to understand protocol operation.
- **TCP:** Analyzed the three-way handshake and data transfer segments.
- **DHCP:** Documented the complete DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge).
- **ICMP:** Captured Echo Request and Reply packets from `ping` commands.

### Part 2: Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation
Designed, built, and configured a functional multi-network enterprise environment.
- **IP Subnetting:** Designed an addressing scheme using VLSM for `105.20.4.0/23`.
- **Network Topology:** Built a network with 5 routers connecting multiple subnets (Data Center, Company A, Company B, Office 1, Office 2).
- **Device Configuration:** Assigned static IPs to PCs and servers.
- **Services:** Configured a DNS server (`www.ENCS3320.com`) and a custom HTTP web server.
- **Routing:** Implemented OSPF dynamic routing on all routers for full connectivity.
- **Testing:** Verified connectivity with `ping` and `traceroute` between all devices.
